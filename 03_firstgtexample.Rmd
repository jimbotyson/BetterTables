# A minimal gt() example

Just as with plots created with **ggplot2()**, it is useful to create tables with **gt()** incrementally (and of course to comment your code).

We first grab and wrangle some data and then create  a simple table.

```{r}
# libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

# flush environment

rm(list = ls())

# read some data

df <- read_csv("https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ccaajim/results.csv")

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(avxm = round((maths+english+history)/3))


gt_tbl <- df %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  gt(caption="This is a table!")

# Show the gt Table
gt_tbl
```
