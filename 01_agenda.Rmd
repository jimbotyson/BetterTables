# Agenda and goals

I want to give you some idea of the variety of packages that exist to improve your experience and results creating tables using R.

I will quickly review some popular packages; give brief examples from ***xtable***, ***kable*** and ***kableExtra***, and then move on to describe ***gt*** in more detail, with a glance sideways and ***gtExtras***.

I don't think you will learn all about using the gt() package in this session but that you will be motivated to learn more about it.

Unfortunately, no package really does everything and rather annoyingly doing some things (captions and cross-references) can require some ugly hacking to get the result you want. Sometimes you will have to choose between bad and worse outcomes.
